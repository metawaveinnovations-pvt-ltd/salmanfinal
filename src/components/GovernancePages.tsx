        a: "We operate a zero-tolerance policy. Any concern is logged immediately onto our digital care management platform (Nourish), triggering automated alerts to our senior leadership team and the local safeguarding board within 2 hours of the report."
      },
      {
        q: "What role does Positive Behaviour Support (PBS) play in ensuring resident safety?",
        a: "PBS is our primary tool for safety. Instead of using restrictive practices, we analyze communicative triggers, modify the sensory environment, and equip individuals with tailored visual coping tools to reduce distress and prevent incidents."
      },
      {
        q: "How are medication administration errors actively prevented?",
        a: "We utilize electronic Medication Administration Records (eMAR) with barcode scanning. This ensures accurate dosing schedules and mandates secondary digital verification for critical medicines, with regular double-audits by senior practitioners."
      },
      {
        q: "How do you design psychologically safe living environments?",
        a: "Through sensory adaptations. Our home, 6 Flags House, includes non-flicker acoustic lighting, warm temperature controls, soundproofing, and spacious private areas designed to minimise sensory overload and eliminate stress triggers."
      },
      {
        q: "Are staff trained to spot and prevent abuse or neglect?",
        a: "Yes, all team members undergo mandatory Care Certificate training and annual Level 3 Safeguarding training, supplemented by reflective post-incident debriefs to continuously sharpen observation and protective skills."
      },
      {
        q: "How do you maintain transparency with commissioners and regulatory bodies?",
        a: "Every incident, risk assessment, and medication record is stored on an immutable digital ledger. This system is accessible on demand to local authority commissioners, social workers, and CQC inspectors for complete oversight."

    effective: [
      {
        q: "How do you ensure that care plans are genuinely co-produced with the resident?",
        a: "We use symbol-rich visual guides, communication tools, and speech-and-language resources. Each resident meets weekly with their keyworker to update their personal goals, choosing what they want to cook, achieve, and explore."
      },
      {
        q: "What is the 'Active Support' model and how does it promote independence?",
        a: "Active Support means doing tasks with the individual, not for them. We break down daily routines—like baking, laundry, or gardening—into small, manageable steps, allowing residents to build confidence and practical life skills at their own pace."
      },
      {
        q: "How do you track and measure daily lifestyle and functional outcomes?",
        a: "We measure 32 developmental criteria daily via our digital care system. This allows us to map progress in areas like motor skills, communication, personal care, and social interactions, producing monthly visual reports for review."
      },

      },
      {
        q: "How do you support healthy nutritional and sensory diets?",
        a: "Each resident has a personalised food and sensory plan. We offer bespoke sensory diets (like swinging, rocking, or deep-pressure activities) alongside customised menus that accommodate food intolerances, swallowing guidelines, and personal preferences."
      },
      {
        q: "How do you ensure staff have the clinical competence to deliver effective support?",
        a: "Our training curriculum includes specialized modules in Autism Spectrum Conditions, PBS, Trauma-Informed Care, and epilepsy management. Competency is assessed through on-floor observations and structured theoretical tests."

    caring: [
      {
        q: "How does PRO Care Homes uphold the dignity and privacy of each resident?",

        q: "How do you champion and amplify the voice of non-verbal residents?",
        a: "We implement augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) tools, including PECS cards, tablets, and customizable visual schedules. Every team member is trained to read subtle behavioural cues, ensuring no voice is overlooked."
      },
      {
        q: "What steps do you take to support diverse identities, cultures, and beliefs?",
        a: "We co-create individual identity plans that detail cultural preferences, spiritual beliefs, dietary rules, and personal celebrations. We support residents to attend local places of worship, prepare cultural foods, and celebrate key calendar events."
      },
      {
        q: "How do you foster meaningful, values-led companionship?",
        a: "We match residents with support staff who share similar hobbies, musical tastes, or interests. Our matching system ensures that support is not just practical, but built on authentic, warm human relationships."
      },
      {
        q: "How are family members involved in the care circle?",
        a: "We hold monthly family feedback sessions, invite relatives to key planning reviews, and utilize a secure family portal on our digital platform to share daily positive moments, photos, and progress updates."
      },
      {
        q: "What is your approach to supporting resident choices in daily schedules?",
        a: "Choice is paramount. From selecting daily outfits and decor choices to deciding weekend activities and bedtimes, residents hold full autonomy. We utilize visual choice boards to make decision-making accessible and clear."
      }
    ],
    responsive: [
      {
        q: "How do you handle and learn from complaints or constructive feedback?",

      },
      {
        q: "What is the process for reviewing and adjusting risk management plans?",
        a: "Rather than avoiding risk, we manage it positively. Risk assessments are reviewed monthly or immediately following any minor incident. We focus on steps that build individual confidence and allow positive risk-taking safely."
      },
      {
        q: "How are lessons learned from post-incident debriefs put into practice?",
        a: "Following any distress or incident, we hold structured, non-blaming debriefs with both the resident and staff. We identify the environmental or physiological triggers and immediately update the care plan with refined support strategies."
      },
      {
        q: "How do you facilitate smooth, personalised transitions into our homes?",
        a: "We use highly personalised introduction schedules. This includes gradual daytime visits, sharing meals, and overnight stays, coupled with a co-produced visual transition book featuring photos of the home and staff to build familiarity."
      },
      {
        q: "How do you support residents who wish to transition to more independent settings?",
        a: "We actively promote pathways to supported living or community independence. We work closely with commissioners to gradually adjust support ratios, teaching budgeting, cooking, and travel skills to prepare residents for their next step."
      },
      {
        q: "What measures are in place to ensure staff training is continually updated?",
        a: "We run a continuous professional development (CPD) programme. Support workers have access to advanced training pathways in specialized leadership, clinical practice, and advanced behavioural therapies to ensure our methods remain modern."

      },
      {
        q: "What role do independent external consultants play in your governance?",
        a: "We employ independent CQC compliance experts to conduct quarterly 'mock inspections.' These rigorous, external audits review our medication systems, safeguarding logs, estate conditions, and staff files to provide unbiased quality benchmarks."
      },
      {
        q: "How does financial stability impact the standard of care provided?",
        a: "Led by accountant Deeshan Walpitagamage, our healthy financial structure enables continuous reinvestment. This guarantees high staff-to-resident ratios, spacious and premium adapted properties, and advanced technological tools like Nourish."
      },
      {
        q: "How do you promote an open, transparent, and honest workplace culture?",
        a: "We maintain a strict open-door policy and a robust, anonymous whistleblowing channel. Staff are encouraged to speak up about improvements, raise clinical suggestions, and challenge existing structures without fear of reprisal."
      },
      {
        q: "How do you track and report key clinical performance metrics?",
        a: "We compile a monthly Clinical Governance Dashboard. This tracks indicators such as incident rates, medication accuracy, training compliance, and family feedback, which is reviewed by the board to trigger immediate proactive adjustments."
      },
      {
        q: "How do you ensure complete alignment with CQC Regulation 17?",
        a: "By establishing clear, written schemes of delegation, structured policy reviews, and robust auditing loops. Every decision, from operational changes to policy updates, is documented, accountable, and easily inspectable."

    rightsupport: [
      {
        q: "How does PRO Care Homes actively implement the 'Right Support' guidelines?",
        a: "We focus on individual choice and control. Residents are not fit into pre-existing schedules; instead, we build the staffing, daily routines, and local community activities entirely around the personal desires, skills, and goals of each resident."
      },
      {
        q: "What does 'Right Care' look like in practice for autistic individuals?",
        a: "It means deep sensory understanding. We avoid crowded environments, tailor home interiors to match sensory profiles (e.g., using calming colours and acoustic insulation), and ensure that staff communicate using clear, direct, and supportive language."
      },
      {
        q: "How do you foster a 'Right Culture' that rejects old, institutional habits?",
        a: "We promote a domestic, family-like atmosphere. Staff do not wear uniforms, and we reject rigid shift rules. Residents cook, dine, and relax side-by-side with staff, building an inclusive environment where everyone is a valued citizen."
      },
      {
        q: "How do you support residents to build meaningful community relationships?",

      },
      {
        q: "Are residents supported to manage their own personal finances and bank accounts?",
        a: "Absolutely. We co-develop financial capability plans. Through visual budgeting aids, supervised bank visits, and simple shopping logs, we help residents understand money management and retain control over their personal funds."
      },
      {
        q: "How do you ensure that support plans are dynamic and adapt as the individual grows?",
        a: "We run quarterly formal reviews and weekly informal check-ins. If a resident develops a new interest, expresses a change in routine, or shows increased independence, their care plan and support model are immediately updated to reflect their progress."
